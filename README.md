## Data Analytics API

This project provides a RESTful API for performing data analysis tasks using libraries like NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn (sklearn), and optionally Keras/TensorFlow.

### Features

* **Data preprocessing:** Standardize, normalize, or engineer features as needed.
* **Data analysis:** Leverage scikit-learn models like linear regression, classification, clustering, etc. (functionality depends on your implementation).
* **JSON output:** Receive analysis results in a JSON format for easy integration with your frontend applications.

### Technologies

* **Backend:** Express.js
* **Data Science Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn (specific functions based on your implementation)
* **Optional:** Keras, TensorFlow (for deep learning tasks)

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShivanshKothari/pyApi.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd pyApi
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the server:**

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   This will start the server on port 3000 by default.

### API Endpoint

The API provides a GET endpoint at `/data`:

```
GET /data
```

This endpoint performs data analysis and returns the results in JSON format. The specific analysis logic depends on your implementation.
